greeting_neutral_Can you not be here right now?
greeting_neutral_Are you gonna say something, or…?
greeting_bad_Can’t you see we’re busy?

response_good_Hmph. Snarky. Okay.
response_good_Second snarky person I've seen tonight. 
response_good_He was around here like, so long ago.
response_good_Finally, someone who knows true fashion. 
response_good_Maybe you could go educate poor Joe. 
response_good_I saw him like, a while back. 
response_neutral_What are you from, the 90s?
response_neutral_The only thing good would be you leaving me alone. 
response_neutral_Eh. It's a party. 
response_neutral_Maybe you could go talk to the other weirdo here. 
response_neutral_I saw someone popping balloons a while ago.

response_neutral_How about you go bug someone else?
response_neutral_He was around here like, so long ago.
response_neutral_Hmph. Snarky. Oaky. 
response_neutral_Another asshole earlier was snarky too. 	
response_neutral_Maybe that annoying kid will humor you. 
response_neutral_Excuse you, this is obviously Perder. 
response_neutral_Why don't you go talk to the other poor kid?
response_neutral_I saw him like, a while back.
response_neutral_Finally, someone who isn't fashion dumb. 
response_neutral_Not like that idiot, Joe. 
response_bad_How about you go talk to the other freaks?
response_bad_Just get lost. 
response_bad_Christ, you can't even talk right. 
response_bad_Just get lost.
response_bad_Hmph. Snarky. Okay. 
response_bad_How pathetic. 
response_bad_Why don't you just scurry off, rat.
response_bad_Look, I'm not really looking for a conversation. 
response_bad_Especially with trash like you. 
response_bad_Flattery will get you nowhere. 
response_bad_I mean who dressed you, your mother?
response_bad_Go bother someone else.
response_bad_This is Perder, idiot. 
response_bad_Are you as dumb as you are poor?
